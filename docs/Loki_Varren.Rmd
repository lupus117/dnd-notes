Gimmley, my stupid brother, what separates man from animal? The ability to think and feel. For the last time I am telling you to stop with that twisted ideology of yours. Those are people, the reason why so little of my men want to be with you is because they are disgusted by you. 

Anyways, I need you and your men to go south. The wind tells me that there might be an interesting place that might be useful to us in the **woods near the Tior** mountain range. Could be a new hideout for us and also could be full of **relics** or something. I will warn you though, lay low and take your time. I was told that the place is a **darkzone.** Get a sniffer or somethin, make sure you leave no trace of dark glow else the horde will come smelling after you. Find the place, secure the area, and then report back to me.

##### Longinus

Once an adventurer who sought only justice and goodness, he became a paladin and ascended to godhood. Now he guides his followers on a path of glory, those few that still believe in such a lofty idea like justice.

Longinus is the god that governs justice and kindness. He is the staple paladin god who does only goodness. A shining beacon in the darkness, those who serve him bow to no evil and will stop at nothing to do good.

## Backstory

### Birthplace

Born to a poor family, River's parents struggled to get by. 
Little does he remember of them, his mother's gentle embrace, his father's sharp features. And the last time he saw them, they went on a walk into the woods, walking for too long for him to keep track. They sat him down on a log next to a stream. Told him to sit still while they go wood chopping... they didn't return.
 
### Lost and Found 
 
He didn't know how much time had passed but it was getting dark. He started wandering downstream, until nightfall. There was a bridge. As He passed out on the side of the bridge. Before he knew it, it was bright, and he was hungry as he woke with a start. The rhythmic thumping of shoes on dirt waking him. A traveling merchant following right behind, picking up the kid and taking him on his back to rest and drink. The merchant asked the kid questions, but he was too young to answer most. Neither did he get the kids name, so he started calling him River, after the place where he found him.

### New Beginnings

River was taken to the **Varren** orphanage. Where he met his new family. His brothers and sisters, the children, and someone he would come to call his dad, **Felix**. River was a goodhearted kid, always trying his best to help and do good. He studied lore with Father Vincent, being enamored by this force of good looking over people holding them took these words into his heart, promising to himself, he would share the blessings the world and it's kind people had given him. After days and months of pleading. River managed to convince Felix to train him. He learned the basics of swordsmanship and strategy, he would use this to protect those he cares for.
